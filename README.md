### Project Description
CookWise is an AI-powered smart cooking assistant that helps users discover recipes based on the ingredients they have at home. By considering time availability, dish preference, and health conditions, it suggests personalized recipes instantly. This makes everyday cooking smarter, healthier, and waste-free.

### The Problem statement
CookWise solves a very real everyday problem 🍽️ — not knowing what to cook with the ingredients already available at home.

Many people spend valuable time searching for recipes, struggle to plan meals with limited groceries, or find it difficult to choose dishes that fit their time ⏱️ or health needs 💚. This often leads to food wastage 🗑️, decision fatigue 😵‍💫, and stressful meal planning.

✨ CookWise transforms this experience by using AI to generate smart, personalized recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, time constraints, dish preferences, and health goals — making cooking faster ⚡, healthier 🥗, and completely stress-free 😊.

### The Solution
We solve this problem by building an AI-powered smart cooking assistant 🤖🍳 that understands what the user already has at home and instantly turns it into practical meal ideas.

✨ CookWise allows users to:

🥕 Select available ingredients
⏱️ Set time constraints
🍽️ Choose dish preferences
💚 Add health considerations

Using this input, our system leverages AI (Gemini) to intelligently match and generate personalized recipes in real time — instead of relying on static recipe lists.

🔍 This ensures that every suggestion is:
✔️ Relevant to what the user actually has
✔️ Suitable for their time availability
✔️ Aligned with their health goals

By combining an intuitive UI with AI-driven decision-making, CookWise transforms everyday cooking from a stressful guessing game into a smart, guided, and efficient experience 🚀.
